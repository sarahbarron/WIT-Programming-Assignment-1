My programming assignment 1


Reflection with Rubric Measures
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part A
Comments, Indentation, naming, structure of code, inclusion of Readme and Reflection.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Having reviewed my work I feel I fall in the excellent category.
I would give myself 100% rounded to the nearest whole number that’s 5/5

I give myself this score as:
- I have a mixture of single and multi-line comments throughout my code. 
  Every method has comments to describe what the method does.

- My code is indented correctly throughout 

- I have used meaningful names, camelCase, action words for methods and I used the correct
  use of naming methods and variables throughout

- I have included a Readme

- I have included a Reflection that has been completed fully and includes line numbers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part B
Working animation i.e. inclusion of the usual Processing class containing the draw(), setup() etc
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Having reviewed my setup and draw functions, I feel I would fall in the excellent category.
I would give myself 100% rounded to the nearest whole number that’s 10/10

I give myself this score as both the setup and draw method are included and are working fully. 
The setup method starts at line 94 and the draw method starts at line 133.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part C
Use of if statements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Having reviewed my code I feel I would fall in the excellent category.
I would give myself 100% rounded to the nearest whole number that’s 10/10

I give myself this score as:

- I have included multiple if statements, for example at lines 338, 529 and 585

- I have included multiple if statements with branches for example
  - At line 282 (if at line 282, else if at line 288 and else at line 294) 
  - Another example of this is at line 384 (if at line 384, else if at line 398, else if at line 412 
    and else if at line 426)
  - A final example of this starts at line 470 (if at line 470, else if at line 482 and else at line 490).

- I have included multiple nested if statements examples of this can be found on lines 541, 625 and 738

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part D
Use of loops
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Having reviewed my code I feel I would fall in the excellent category.
I would give myself 100% rounded to the nearest whole number that’s 20/20

I give myself this score as: 
- I have used multiple for loops for example at lines 124, 248 and 274.
- I have included a while loop at line 198.
- I have included a nested for loop at line 783

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part E
Use of at least one bespoke method you defined and wrote yourself
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Having reviewed my code, I feel I would fall in the excellent category.
I would give myself 100% rounded to the nearest whole number that’s 20/20

I give myself this score as I have included multiple bespoke methods including:
1. getRandomWord at line 172 which is called at lines 118 and 945
2. isGuessRightOrWrong at line 241 which is called at line 225
3. printAlphabet at line 267 which is called at line 150
4. printWord at line 319 which is called at line 153
5. printHangmanDiagram at line 331 which is called at line 155
6. gameOverWinner at line 602 which is called at line 143
